# just
A personal command tool to setup a typescript project, complete with `git` and `jest`.

# Why
Making setting up a new typescript project of mine as frictionless as possible.
# But this whole thing can be a bash script?
Yea, but it's now in Rust c:
# Prerequisite
All these packages/libraries must be installed globally:
1. `npm` & `npx`
2. `git`
3. `typescript`
# How to use
```
mkdir myProject && cd myProject
just
```
This tool is naive in its implementation for a reason: if it breaks I can fix it in a heartbeat.
